        <h1>Usability</h1>
        <p>Our usability would be mesurered by the amount of people signing up for the website and how it might 
            bring more people in by having ads on other websites. We'd mesure sales online vs. in store purchaes 
            and how they might corlate with eachother.
        </p>
        <h1>Accesibility</h1>
        <p>The goal for this websites accesibility would be easy for anyone to use,
            The pople who would be buying these products may be older gentelmen that dont offten use the internet
            so making it clutter free and easy to use would make it easy for them and easy for the web designer to update.
            Having a Text to speech mode in the bottom right would help. 
            Lastly a zoom feature built in to the website woudl help with smaller text.</p>
        
        <h1>Why my Website will add value to to the product</h1>
        <p>I feel that this website will help with the further future of online shopping
            and how much easier it will be to nott have to go into the store to buy/lease a 
            big peice of equiment if they can just ship it to you. AS I feel that the in door shopping experience 
            is fading you always need the backup plan like this.
